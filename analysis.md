# Introduction

Other than the given FCFS algorithm, our group have choosen SJF and priority scheduling for the other 2 algorithms. The purpose is to 
create a system that is highly dependable and not time consuming. 


# Consideration

We have considered some aspects before choosing SJF and priority scheduling for our project. one of the aspects is time which 
is very suitable with using the priority scheduling since it will execute the highest priority process first hence, will save a lot of time. 
for SJF, it usuallty provides the lowest waiting time for a process. this is what we are looking for in the algorithms we choose which is
to emphasize the use of time to its full potential.

## FCFS
first come first serve (FCFS) basis as the process which arrives first will be executed first or in other words that the process which requests the CPU first gets the CPU allocation first. FCFS is the basic of CPU scheduling algorithm. FCFS algorithm does not include any complex logic, all the process is put in queue and executed accordingly which avoids starvation from occuring.

## SJF
shortest job first (SJF) scheduling works by executing the process with the shortest burst time in the first place resulting in the reduction of average waiting time for the next process. this will increase the efficincy of the system hence, more process can be done in a shorter time frame.

## PRIORITY SCHEDULING
Priority schudeling will prioritize process with higher priority. the process with higher priority will be executed first followed by the other processes with lower priority.
