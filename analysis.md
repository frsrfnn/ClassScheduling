# Introduction

Other than the given FCFS algorithm, our group have choosen SJF and priority scheduling for the other 2 algorithms. The purpose is to 
create a system that is highly dependable and not time consuming. 


# Consideration

We have considered some aspects before choosing SJF and priority scheduling for our project. one of the aspects is time which 
is very suitable with using the priority scheduling since it will execute the highest priority process first hence, will save a lot of time. 
for SJF, it usuallty provides the lowest waiting time for a process. this is what we are looking for in the algorithms we choose which is
to emphasize the use of time to its full potential.
